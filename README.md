# Perspective-Crop
Trying to do the perspective crop effect selecting 4 points and transforming the image changing its perspective

To edit the source code (at least on eclipse) you need to: 
* Install openCV and JavaFx libraries
* Add them to the project
* Add argument to java run config -> VM -> --module-path "javafx lib path" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
